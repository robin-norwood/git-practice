# Practice repository to start learning Git

## Commands used

- git init: Create a repository
- git status: Compare working directory, staging area, and current branch
- git add: Add changes from working directory to staging area
- git commit: Commit changes from staging area to current branch
- git config: Set or get configuration
- git log: Show history of project commits
- git checkout: Check out branch (update HEAD and apply changes to working directory)
- git merge: Merge changes from different branches

## Commit messages

Default editor is vim (this can be changed)
  - `i` to enter *insert* mode
  - Type commit message
  - `Esc` -> `:wq` -> `Enter` to write message and quit
Or use `git commit -m "<message>"`

- First line should be clear, accurate, and concise
- Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation
- Don't end with a `.`

## Merging

Merging means to bring the changes from one branch into another.
